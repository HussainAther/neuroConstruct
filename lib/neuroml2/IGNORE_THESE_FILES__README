The Schema, LEMS Definitions, examples and export/import Java libraries for NeuroML 2 are in the process of moving to GitHub

See https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2
https://github.com/NeuroML/org.neuroml.model
https://github.com/NeuroML/org.neuroml.export, etc.

These old NeuroML2/LEMS jars represent an older version of code being developed on Sourceforge.

The jar files in this folder will eventually be removed in favour of the jar file in the
jNeuroMLJar folder
