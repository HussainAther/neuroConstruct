      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>neuroConstruct is being developed in the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/silverlab/">Silver Lab</a> in the

      <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/npp/">Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology</a> at
          <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk">UCL</a>. neuroConstruct has been designed to simplify development of complex networks
          of biologically realistic neurons, i.e. models incorporating dendritic morphologies and realistic cell membrane conductances.
      It is implemented in Java and generates script files for a number of widely used neuronal simulation platforms
      (including <a  href="docs/Glossary_gen.html#NEURON">NEURON</a>,
      <a  href="docs/Glossary_gen.html#GENESIS">GENESIS</a>, <a  href="http://moose.sourceforge.net">MOOSE</a>,
      <a  href="http://www.psics.org">PSICS</a> and <a href="http://neuralensemble.org/trac/PyNN">PyNN</a>). It uses the
      latest <a href="docs/Glossary_gen.html#NeuroML">NeuroML</a> specifications,
      including <a href="docs/Glossary_gen.html#MorphML">MorphML</a>, <a href="docs/Glossary_gen.html#ChannelML">ChannelML</a>
      and <a href="docs/Glossary_gen.html#NetworkML">NetworkML</a>.</p>

      <p>Development of this software was made possible with funding from the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome
      Trust</a>, the <a href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/">Medical Research Council</a> and the <a href="http://www.eusynapse.mpg.de">EU Synapse Project</a>.</p>

        <title>Latest News</title>

        <p>The latest version of neuroConstruct (<strong>v1.7.4</strong>) is available
        <a href="https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/neuroConstruct/blob/master/INSTALL.md">here</a>.
        The source code has been released under GPL.</p>

        <p>A paper describing version 1 of the Open Source Brain platform has been published:
        <strong>Open Source Brain: a collaborative resource for visualizing, analyzing, simulating and developing standardized models
            of neurons and circuits. Gleeson P, Cantarelli M, Marin B, Quintana A, Earnshaw M, et al. (2019)  Neuron 103
            (3):395â€“411</strong>. Many of the neuroConstruct standard example models are included in that paper.

        <p>A paper describing the latest stable version of NeuroML has been

         describes in detail the structure of version 1.x (Levels 1-3, MorphML, ChannelML, NetworkML), includes a
         detailed discussion of the elements present at each level along with example NeuroML code (see the
         <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/fetchSingleRepresentation.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000815.s001">supporting text</a>
        of the paper), outlines current simulator support, and presents a number of new cell and network models which have been
        converted to the format.</p>

        <p>A morphologically detailed CA1 pyramidal
        cell model and a number of cells from the Traub et al. 2005 thalamocortical
        network model are available <a href="http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/thalamocortical">here</a> for download in NeuroML format or as complete neuroConstruct
        projects for execution on a number of simulation platforms.
        These models are also included with the latest version of neuroConstruct.</p>



        <p>A <a  href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature07604.html">Nature paper</a>
        (<strong>Jason S. Rothman, Laurence Cathala, Volker Steuber, R. Angus Silver,
        Synaptic depression enables neuronal gain control. Nature 2009</strong>) has used neuroConstruct to investigate
        a detailed layer 5 pyramidal cell model (Kole et al 2008) with dendritically distributed excitatory and
        inhibitory synaptic input to look at the effects of short term plasticity on gain control (

      <title>What is neuroConstruct?</title>

      <p>Some of the key features of neuroConstruct are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>neuroConstruct can <a href="samples/index.html#Ex3_Morphology">import</a> morphology files in GENESIS, NEURON,
    Neurolucida, SWC and MorphML format for inclusion in single cell or network models, or more abstract cells can also be built manually.</li>
      <li>Creation of networks of conductance based neurons <a href="samples/index.html#Ex2_Packing">positioned in 3D</a></li>
<li>Complex <a href="samples/index.html#Ex5_Networks">connectivity patterns</a> between cell groups can be specified for the networks </li>
<li>Simulation scripts can be generated for <a  href="docs/Glossary_gen.html#NEURON">NEURON</a>,
      <a  href="docs/Glossary_gen.html#GENESIS">GENESIS</a>, <a  href="http://moose.sourceforge.net">MOOSE</a>,  <a  href="http://www.psics.org">PSICS</a> and
<a  href="http://neuralensemble.org/trac/PyNN">PyNN</a> based simulators (note: not every project can be generated for every simulator)</li>
<li>Biophysically realistic cellular mechanisms (synapses/channel mechanisms) can be imported from native script files (*.mod or *.g) or created from templates using <a href="docs/Glossary_gen.html#ChannelML">ChannelML</a></li>
<li>Automatic generation of code to record simulation data and visualisation/analysis of data in neuroConstruct</li>

<li>Recorded simulation runs can be viewed and managed through the Simulation Browser interface</li>
<li>A <a href="docs/python.html">Python</a> based scripting interface can be used to control model generation and execution, allowing multiple
   simulations to be run for cell and network model optimisation</li>


 </ul>

      <title>What isn't neuroConstruct?</title>

     <ul>
<li>neuroConstruct is not a replacement for neural network simulators like NEURON or GENESIS</li>
</ul>
<p>These packages have sophisticated environments for creating neuronal simulations from scratch,
and controlling all aspects of the simulation run. neuroConstruct automates the generation of script files for
these platforms, and provides a framework for creating conductance based neuronal models, creating, visualising and
analysing networks of cells in 3D, managing simulations and analysing network firing behaviour.</p>
